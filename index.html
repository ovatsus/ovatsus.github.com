  <div class="entry-content"><p>Version <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Data/2.0.0">2.0.0</a> of <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/">FSharp.Data</a> was just released. You can get the full version history on the <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md">release notes</a>, but here are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new type inference algorithm that will generate better and more robust API&#8217;s in the presence of missing and heterogeneous types. This means that you&#8217;ll get much less errors when using JsonProvider and XmlProvider on real world messy files. The error messages are now also more descriptive when things go wrong.</li>
<li>Much improved Freebase support for individuals.</li>
<li>The functionality of the Http class was greatly extended. It now supports uploading and downloading binary files, and compression across all supported platforms, among many other tweaks.</li>
<li>Improved the overall performance of the type provider itself when running inside the editor, and also of the generated code.</li>
<li>The documentation was much improved, there&#8217;s now a Japanese translation of it, and comprehensive reference documentation.</li>
<li>Mono is now fully supported, as well as F# 3.1, and the new Portable Class Library profile 7.</li>
<li>Source link support. This means that you can step trough the source code while debugging if you enable that feature in Visual Studio.</li>
</ul>


<p>We also took the opportunity of major version bump to do some house cleaning, so things that we weren&#8217;t previously very happy with were renamed, dropped or, shuffled around. Unfortunately this means breaking changes, but we think the overall outcome is positive. In this process we dropped support for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Silverlight and Windows Phone separate packages.</li>
<li>Apiary provider (which has now moved to a <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/ApiaryProvider">separate project</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#8217;s still a lot of room for improvement, and we love pull requests, so please contribute, even if it&#8217;s only fixing a typo in the docs. A getting started guide is available <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/contributing.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>For the next versions, we want to add:</p>

<ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the many things F# is great for is screen scraping. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<ul>
<li>Downloading multiple pages asynchronously and in parallel is trivial with F#&#8217;s async support</li>
<li>Navigating the HTML DOM is a great fit for higher order data processing combined with partial application</li>
<li>F# Interactive really shines in iterative processes like this, where you try something out, see it didn&#8217;t work quite well, and keep adjusting until you get it right. Doing a full compile-run cycle on each iteration instead of simply evaluating in the REPL would make this task take much more time-consuming</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/">Html Agility Pack</a> is the obvious candidate to use for screen scraping in .NET, but like other LINQ-like libraries that rely heavily on extension methods, its API isn&#8217;t ideal for use in F#. A simple wrapper will take care of that problem:</p>

In addition to bug fixes, here what&#8217;s has been added to FSharp.Data since then:</p>

<ul>
<li>The behaviour of CsvProvider can be fine tuned by using the HasHeaders, Schema, IgnoreErrors, SafeMode, and PreferOptionals parameters. See the CsvProvider documentation <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>The CSV Parser and Reader can now be used standalone. See the CsvFile documentation <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvFile.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Guid types are now supported in CsvProvider, JsonProvider, and XmlProvider.</li>
<li>Support to disable caching for CSV files too big to fit in memory.</li>
<li>Support for cookies, binary files and client certificates in FSharp.Net.Http.</li>
<li>Save, Filter, Take, TakeWhile, Skip, SkipWhile, and Truncate operations for CsvProvider and CsvFile.</li>
<li>Support for Windows Phone 7.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Type Providers are the biggest new feature of F# 3.0. They allow us to leverage the power of the static type system in areas that have typically been the territory of dynamic languages and stringly typing. A picture is worth a thousand words, so here&#8217;s 12 pictures that show type providers in action:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2013/01/30/twelve-type-providers-in-pictures.aspx">All your types are belong to us</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There are already several good samples and articles about using type providers, but there still isn&#8217;t a lot about creating type providers. Having worked recently on <a href="http://fsharp.github.com/FSharp.Data/">FSharp.Data</a> I decided to share some tips about building type providers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>F# 2.0 supported Silverlight 4, Silverlight 5, and Windows Phone 7.1, as several versions of FSharp.Core.dll were
shipped as part of the standalone F# redistribution. There were even some nice <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/08/20/f-windows-phone-7-silverlight-templates-now-on-visual-studio-gallery.aspx">Visual Studio 2010 templates</a> made by <a href="http://bloggemdano.blogspot.co.uk/">Daniel Mohl</a>.</p>

<p>In F# 3.0 there is no standalone redistributable package anymore, and Visual Studio 2012 only ships with two versions of FSharp.Core.dll: the full .NET 4.5 version, and a portable class library version targeting Profile47 (which includes .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5.0, and .NET for Windows Store apps).</p>

<p>I tried to create versions for Windows Phone 7 and for Profile88 (which additionally includes .NET 4.0, Silverlight 4.0, and Windows Phone 7.1) from the <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp">source code</a>, and I even got them to <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp/pull/102">compile</a>, but unfortunately I still get a bunch of Invalid Program exceptions at runtime when running on the emulator or on the device for both versions.</p>

<p>So I tried another approach - to reuse the FSharp.Core.dll version from F# 2.0 - and it seems to work just fine. Type providers and other new F# 3.0 features that depend on the library won&#8217;t work, but at least we can use Visual Studio 2012 and some of the features like the triple quotes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
	<strong>EDIT</strong>: As another version of the ml-class course has started, I&#39;ve made the repository private</p>
<p>
	Back when I was in college, I took three different courses that dealt with subjects related to machine learning and data mining. Although I didn&rsquo;t lose interest on those matters, my work has led me in a totally unrelated direction, so I haven&rsquo;t exercised any of that knowledge in about eight years or so. A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon Stanford&rsquo;s online class on <a href="http://www.ml-class.org">Machine Learning</a> and decided to enroll. I want to revive many of the things I have forgotten and try to put them into practice, as nowadays it&rsquo;s very easy to access large amounts of interesting data from all kinds of online sources.</p>
<p>
	The programming exercises of this class are supposed to be done in Octave or Matlab, and while I understand the advantages of these tools, my past experience (where all the exercises and projects were done either with SAS or with Matlab) shows me that not using a general purpose programming languages doesn&rsquo;t help a lot in turning academic exercises into real world programs. As professor Andrew Ng said in the introduction, one of the goals of the class is for us to put machine learning into practice in real world problems we care about, so I decided that I&rsquo;ll implement all the algorithms and exercises in F#.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Background</h3>  <p>Back in 2004, I was doing some code-generation work as part of the <a href="http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/project-pages/past-projects/obiwan">OBIWAN</a> project. When I started, CodeDom was being used to do the work, but I really didn’t like it because it made the generator code very hard to read and modify. Realistically, I would not need to support any other language than C#, so I started looking for alternatives. <a href="http://www.codesmithtools.com/product/generator">CodeSmith</a> was very popular at the time for generating type-safe collections (.NET 2.0 generics didn’t exist yet), but it was targeted at one-shot generations, and not at creating code generation code. Then I found a very simple tool named <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060726075638/http://www.inmetrix.com/">CodeGen</a> that appealed to me. I had been playing around with the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/?view=category_Preprocessor">Boost Preprocessor library</a> recently, so I really liked the idea of using the preprocessor. I did a few tweaks to it and was able to use it for my needs at the time. Later on, around mid-2007, I needed to do code-generation again, so I took this tool and added a good amount of more power to it. At this time, it was very far apart from the original code, so I re-baptized it as PreSharp and published it to CodePlex. I never got around to do any documentation for it, so I’m making this post to try to compensate for that. I also moved the project recently from CodePlex to <a href="https://github.com/ovatsus/PreSharp">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
	I have&nbsp; a love-hate relationship with WPF.</p>
<p>
	I think it is several orders of magnitude better than Windows Forms and gives developers a tremendous expressive power to materialize their ideas into good user interfaces. I wouldn&rsquo;t dream of doing many of the things I was able to do in just a few weeks in the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform IDE</a> in any other UI framework, even if I was given months. It&rsquo;s like going from plain C to C# 4.</p>
<p>
	But even though the concept is really good, the quality and completeness of the concrete implementation are really not there. There are just too many quirks, weird limitations, parts that don&rsquo;t play nice with others, performance problems, memory leaks, etc&#8230; And when things don&rsquo;t work as they should, many times you really have to go out of your way to be able to fix things.</p>
<p>
	I understand deadlines and priorities, and I know that probably Microsoft just had to ship something at some point, but it really seems that there was a big lack of dogfooding in the WPF case.</p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s a striking example of this: what was the number one complaint that developers had about WPF since 2006?&hellip; Blurry text and images. And when did Microsoft fix it?&hellip; Only in 2010, when they started using WPF for Visual Studio.</p>
<p>
	Another issue that has been bugging me since I started using WPF was the airspace limitation. It seems that <a href="http://www.jonathanantoine.com/2011/09/24/wpf-4-5-%E2%80%93-part-8-no-more-airspace-problems-integrating-wpf-with-win32/">it&rsquo;s finally going to be fixed in 4.5</a>. Why do I think it&rsquo;s being solved now? Because they probably needed some native WinRT component to play nice with WPF&hellip;</p>
<p>
	I think eating you own dog food is really important. At <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a> we use our product to build all web applications: the R&amp;D apps (bug tracking, project management, continuous integration&hellip;), the HR apps (directory, vacations, recruiting&hellip;), the sales apps, the marketing apps, the corporate site, the community forums, etc&hellip; And I can say with a great deal of confidence that if we didn&rsquo;t do that, our product wouldn&rsquo;t be half of what it is today.</p>
<p>
	Bottom line: we as developers should always try to eat our own dog food as much as we can. In fact, I think it&rsquo;s so important that it should have been item 13 in the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Test</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
	My blog was running in <a href="http://subtextproject.com">SubText</a>, but I&rsquo;ve recently changed to <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine.NET</a>. The main reason for the change was that BlogEngine.NET supports storing the data in plain XML files, without having any dependency to a database. This makes it really easy to customize, as I can develop everything in my local machine, and then just send the files to the server. With SubText this was harder to do, so I ended up doing fewer tweaks, and doing them directly in production, which I didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>
	The migration wasn&rsquo;t as smooth as I though it would be, so here are the steps I took, in case someone needs to go through a similar process:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Exporting to BlogML and then importing didn&rsquo;t work correctly. After exporting, I had to <a href="http://garfoot.com/blog/2010/08/importing-blogml-into-wordpress/">convert the content from Base64</a>, replace the &amp;amp;&rsquo;s in the titles with &amp;, and then manually set the author in all post. I also had to set the tags manually in all posts, as in SubText they weren&rsquo;t a separate field but instead were part of the content of the posts. Having the posts on xml files on disk rather than on a database eased this job a lot.</li>
	<li>
		The TinyMCE bundled in BlogEngine.NET doesn&rsquo;t support images, so I had to <a href="http://jerryhuang.net/post/Replace-TinyMCE-with-CKEditor-and-CKFinder-in-BlogEngine-20.aspx">replace it with CKEditor and CKFinder</a>.</li>
	<li>
		The SubText post URL&#39;s have the format /archive/year/month/day/name-of-the-post.aspx, while BlogEngine.NET post URL&#39;s have the format /server/post/year/month/day/name-of-the-post.aspx. I had to set up redirection so the old links would keep working. To do that I&rsquo;ve taken the source code from <a href="http://www.blogenginewall.com/post/2011/04/01/BlogEngine-SEO-Permanent-Redirection-From-Old-URL-To-New-URL.aspx">BlogEngine SEO Redirection extension</a> and changed the comparison to only check prefixes (source code <a href="https://github.com/ovatsus/Blog/commit/a8c8c3f0984507182b2a0139aa2fcbdcb5a51358">here</a>).</li>
	<li>
		Several of the extensions available out there don&rsquo;t work out of the box with the latest version of BlogEngine.NET (2.5):
		<ul>
			<li>
				For the AddThis extension I had to <a href="http://www.mbaldinger.com/post/AddThisNET-Social-Bookmarking-Buttons-for-Blogengine-v5.aspx#id_7b41fd26-f300-4029-b606-60b0cc2f0e6d">add some missing using&rsquo;s to the code</a>, and disable the form validation of the settings page (source code <a href="https://github.com/ovatsus/Blog/commit/931e4f13c76f8505ea65cd6d154fd29354526fbb">here</a>).</li>
			<li>
				To be able to configure widgets in the AllTuts theme, I had to make a small bug fix (as described in Janier Davila comment <a href="http://www.pravesh.me/alltuts-theme-blogenginenet-updated-v25/">here</a>)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	After all that work, now I have a setup that allows me to tweak the blog very easily. I have it on GitHub, cloned into my local machine and into the server. I can play around locally, and when I&rsquo;m glad with the results I just need to do a git push locally and then remote desktop to the server to do a git pull and force a reload of the application by touching the web.config.</p>
<p>
	Of course, to protect my passwords and keys, I have to tell git to ignore users.xml, akismetfilter.xml and recaptcha.xml, using <a href="http://blog.pagebakers.nl/2009/01/29/git-ignoring-changes-in-tracked-files/">this procedure</a>. And I also must take care with the email settings that are stored on the global settings.xml file, which forces me to always have that file uncommitted at the server, but other than that, it&rsquo;s orders of magnitude better than editing directly on production.</p>
